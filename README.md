# Log Error Stuck

## MPU6050

- mpu has been tested to using library adafruit, still able to error
- mpu has been tested without madgwick, but still able to error
- mpu run fine if not playing with control

# Control System

- mockXY(dir) is running fine with other program
- runManual seems to be the issue..

# General Program

- adding more delay seems to lessen the stuck probability
